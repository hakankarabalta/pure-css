# HTML & CSS Component Playground 🚀

Welcome to my personal testing ground for web styling and structure! This repository is a collection of modular, section-based components designed to test and refine my front-end development skills.

## 🛠 Project Architecture
Instead of a single monolithic page, this project follows a **component-based approach**. Each section (Hero, Navbar, Cards, etc.) is treated as an independent module to ensure scalability and clean code.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Modular Design:** Section-based architecture for easy reuse.
* **Responsive Layouts:** Extensive use of Media Queries for mobile, desktop, and landscape orientations.
* **CSS Experiments:** Testing modern CSS features like Flexbox, Grid, and custom animations.

## 📱 Highlights: Responsive Hero Section
One of the core components in this project is a highly adaptive **Hero Section**. It features specific logic for different viewing contexts:
* **Standard View:** Balanced height for readability.

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Explore the different sections to see the CSS implementations in action.
